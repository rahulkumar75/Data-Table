# Data Table
This repository contains a React component called DataTable, designed to manage and display a collection of user data. It provides functionality for adding, editing, deleting, and searching user entries, as well as pagination to navigate through the data efficiently.

# Key Features
* Add User Data: Users can input details such as name, gender, and age to add new entries to the table.
* Edit User Data: Entries in the table are editable. Clicking the edit button enables inline editing for the specific entry.
* Delete User Data: Users can remove entries from the table.
* Search: The table includes a search function to filter entries by name.
* Pagination: Data is displayed in pages, with navigation buttons to switch between pages.
  
# Components and Functions
State Variables
formData: Object to hold form input values.
data: Array to hold user data.
editId: Stores the ID of the entry currently being edited.
searchTerm: Stores the current search query.
currentPage: Tracks the current page in the pagination.

# References
* outSideClick: Ref to detect clicks outside the editable area to exit edit mode.


# Usage
* Adding Data: Users can input data in the form fields and click the "Add" button to add a new entry to the table.
* Editing Data: Clicking the "Edit" button next to an entry makes the fields editable. Clicking outside the editable area or focusing away from the field saves the changes.
* Deleting Data: Clicking the "Delete" button next to an entry removes it from the table.
* Searching Data: The search input filters the table based on the user's query.
* Pagination: Pagination buttons allow users to navigate through the pages of data.

# Future Enhancements
* Enhanced Validation: Implement validation for input fields to ensure data integrity.
* Sorting: Add functionality to sort entries by different criteria.
* Advanced Search: Allow searching by other fields such as gender or age.
* Better UI/UX: Improve the design and user experience with advanced styling and animations.
